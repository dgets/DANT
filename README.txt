Damo's Alarms 'N Timers
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This application was first considered when I realized that there was no real
stock freeware application for Windows [that I've been able to find] that
handles a multipurpose alarms and timers function.  At least not on any of the
freeware or open source sites that I've been able to google so far.  I was
impressed by the capability of the stock 'Alarms' application that comes
bundled with the fresh install X11 applications for Ubuntu and Debian, so at
first I was trying to model my application after this.  While not really
similar in appearance, the purpose is similar-- to make available an infinite
amount of concurrently capable specific alarm settings (with custom
notification sounds) and countdown timers (also with custom notification
sounds).

This is my first serious application in C# and as such I am learning quite a
bit about the language and proper coding technique as I go.  This is a work in
progress and should not be judged on its codebase or functionality until I say
that it's complete and perfect.  :)
